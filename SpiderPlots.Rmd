OK - Trying to figure out how to do spider plot / radar chart
Looks like there are a few packages that apparently do this that don't work. 
1. ggplot2 +ggradar - can't find ggradar
2. spider - can't load part of the package
3. radarchart - doesn't work, seems to be used for interactive radar charts
4. fmbs - This one works!  Not sure how to adjust, can probably make fancier with ggplot2 later
```{r fmsb}
# Library
library(fmsb)
 
# Create data: note in High school for Jonathan:
data=as.data.frame(matrix( sample( 2:20 , 10 , replace=T) , ncol=10))
colnames(data)=c("math" , "english" , "biology" , "music" , "R-coding", "data-viz" , "french" , "physic", "statistic", "sport" )
 
# To use the fmsb package, I have to add 2 lines to the dataframe: the max and min of each topic to show on the plot!
data=rbind(rep(20,10) , rep(0,10) , data)
 
# The default radar chart proposed by the library:
radarchart(data)
 
# Custom the radarChart !
radarchart( data  , axistype=1 , 
 
    #custom polygon
    pcol=rgb(0.2,0.5,0.5,0.9) , pfcol=rgb(0.2,0.5,0.5,0.5) , plwd=4 , 
 
    #custom the grid
    cglcol="grey", cglty=1, axislabcol="grey", caxislabels=seq(0,20,5), cglwd=0.8,
 
    #custom labels
    vlcex=0.8 
    )
```
